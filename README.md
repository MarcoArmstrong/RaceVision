## Purpose 🏎️
An IRacing free overlay solution until they finish their UX overhaul, and potentially longer depending on their implementation. Uses IRacing SDK data to display extra information that they expose, but currently do not show the user.

## Tech Stack Quick Look 🚀

## RoadMap 🗺️
(Need to update)
 - V1 state for few overlays for solo practive/qualifying/race sessions (Relative, Standings, Input Graph, Advanced Inputs, Fuel Calculator) to start 📌(currently here)
 - Complete spectator view
 - Get team races working correctly
 - Add more overlays (radar, track map, etc)
 - Integrate home dashboard displaying user race statistics

## Known Bugs 🐛
(move to issues section for tracking eventually)
 - Relative time isn't that accurate when drivers are far away or near start/finish line
